4. **Completion Page:** View success/failure confirmation, transaction receipt, download/share receipt, start new transaction.

## 5. Base Solidity Smart Contract

The project includes a Solidity smart contract to track usage and transaction statistics on the blockchain. This contract is designed to:

- Track total transaction count.
- Record successful and failed transactions.
- Maintain user activity statistics.
- Store transaction completion status.

### Example Base Solidity Smart Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UsageTracker {
    uint256 public totalTransactions;
    uint256 public successfulTransactions;
    uint256 public failedTransactions;

    mapping(address => uint256) public userTransactionCount;
    mapping(address => uint256) public userSuccessfulTransactions;

    event TransactionRecorded(address indexed user, bool success);

    function recordTransaction(address user, bool success) external {
        totalTransactions += 1;
        userTransactionCount[user] += 1;

        if (success) {
            successfulTransactions += 1;
            userSuccessfulTransactions[user] += 1;
        } else {
            failedTransactions += 1;
        }

        emit TransactionRecorded(user, success);
    }

    function getUserStats(address user) external view returns (uint256 total, uint256 successful) {
        return (userTransactionCount[user], userSuccessfulTransactions[user]);
    }
}
```

This contract can be extended to include more detailed tracking and integration with the EaseCrypt platform backend.
